HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value" -->
    

<!-- The href Attribute
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to: -->
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

    <!-- The src Attribute
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed: -->

<img src="AdMob-Dark.png">

<!-- here are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain. -->



<!-- The width and height Attributes
The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels): -->

<img src = "AdMob-Dark.png" width="500" height="600" >
